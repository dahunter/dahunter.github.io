I'm intent on making development my full-time gig, and am currently on the road to making it happen. Take a look at my journey so far:</p>

                  <p>In elementary school I developed an interest in art and math. I enjoyed the creativity and problem solving involved, and those aspects became the focus of my hobbies outside of school. My interests later extended to science and then to philosophy, as I continued to ask questions and considered how things could be made better. This handful of characteristics--curiosity, independence, creativity and problem solving, is what motivates me today.</p>

                  <p>Development first caught my attention when a departmental project at work got me collaborating with the engineering team. I had been hired on to manage customer invoicing via an internal proprietary billing application. As I worked together with the engineers on bug fixes and upkeep, I began to understand a little more about the work they were doing. The billing app proved to be clunky and inefficient, making long and tedious work  of something that could potentially be fully-automated. I worked directly with developers and product management to plan out a complete redesign of the app from end to end.</p>

                  <p>Radmin (Radiate Admin) was intended to be an all-in-one internal solution for managing our clients' accounts, but the project was shelved when business priorities shifted and development time was redirected elsewere. This got me thinking that if the engineers didn't have the time for it, I could learn to build the billing parts I needed myself.</p>

She cares about her work and it shows.  She has shown real dedication and natural talent for development and problem solving.</p>

                <p>Her work ethic, thirst for knowledge, and natural aptitude already make her a great developer to work with.  I can't think of a more ideal candidate for an apprenticeship opportunity.</p>

                <p>As head of the engineering department at Sole Solution, I have worked with Ms. Hunter for several years. When our company created an internal program for employees to learn software development with the engineering team, Dani was the first to join and consistently the most dedicated. She frequently sacrificed her lunch break to have more time to build her skills.</p>

                <p>Ms. Hunter has a tremendous hunger to learn and expand her experience, which has been central to her roles within Sole Solution, allowing her to streamline processes and do the work that previously required several other employees. She has also learned web software development outside of work hours, pairing with various mentors and working on several outside projects.</p>

                <p>She is exactly the sort of person I would look for to hire onto my team, as she has the self-motivation, drive, and intelligence to take a task to completion.</p>

            <p><strong>To Whom It May Concern:</strong></p>

            <p>I am writing to offer my glowing recommendation of Danielle Hunter for the intern position at MX.</p>

            <p>Danielle slept through the night almost immediately as a baby and had hair so beautiful that perfect strangers would stop us to compliment her. She tenaciously competed to win the "Math around the World" competition in her first grade classroom. And although she barely weighs 100 lbs as a full-grown adult, she is still Dad's number one choice for lifting the heaviest furniture in the house. He brags about that as often as he brags about her almost perfect ACT score and her winning a competitive Honors' Scholarship at Arkansas State University.</p>

            <p>She will eat almost anything (everything!), and is a loyal and dedicated young woman with a bright future. You will quickly find that Danielle can solve almost any problem.</p>

            Best regards, <br />
            Dixie D. Thompson <br />
