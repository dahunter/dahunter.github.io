                  <p>My path to software development began early on in life. As a kid I was curious and inquisitive--always wanting to try new things and determined to do everything for myself. I asked too many questions and often got in trouble for it. A toddler can only ask "why?" so many times before the answer becomes "because I said so!"</p>

                  <p>I developed an interest in art and math in elementary school. I enjoyed the creativity and problem solving involved and those aspects became the focus of my hobbies outside of school. My interests later extended to science and then to philosophy, as I continued to ask questions and considered how things could be made better. This handful of characteristics--curiosity, independence, creativity and problem solving, is still what motivates me today.</p>

                <div class="landmark-body">
                  <p>Development first caught my attention when a departmental project at work got me collaborating with the engineering team. I had been hired on to manage customer invoicing via an internal proprietary billing application. As I worked together with the engineers on bug fixes and upkeep, I began to understand a little more about the work they were doing. The billing app proved to be clunky and inefficient, making long and tedious work  of something that could potentially be fully-automated. I worked directly with the developers and product management to plan out a complete redesign of the app from end to end.</p>

                  <p>Radmin (Radiate Admin) was intended to be an all-in-one internal solution for managing our clients' accounts, but the project was put on hiatus when business priorities shifted and development time was redirected elsewere. This got me thinking that if the engineers didn't have the time for Radmin, I could learn to build the billing parts that I needed myself.</p>

                <div class="landmark-body">
                  <p>After the Radmin project was shelved, I began learning a handful of programming languages via books and online resources--primarily HTML and CSS through Codecademy, along with some JavaScript and Ruby. I was accepted to the Rails Girls conference in March of 2014, which furthered my motivation and excitement about becoming a part of the development industry.</p>

                  <p>The engineering team at my work created an internal program for employees to learn software development--I spent an hour on most days pairing with them as I built my own Rails app. Outside of work, I've continued to make my way through more online resources as well--improving my HTML and CSS skills, building my first video game in JavaScript and dabbling a tiny bit in Phaser. I am currently working on a couple of small personal projects in an effort to solidify and fine tune the skills I have learned so far, and also just for the fun of it.</p>

When our company created an internal program for employees to learn software development with the engineering team, Dani was the first to join and consistently the most dedicated. She frequently sacrificed her lunch break to have more time to build her skills.</p>

                <p>Ms. Hunter has a tremendous hunger to learn and expand her experience, which has been central to her roles within Sole Solution, allowing her to streamline processes and do the work that previously required several other employees. She has also learned web software development outside of work hours, pairing with various mentors and working on several outside projects.</p>

            <p>I am writing to offer my glowing recommendation of Danielle Hunter for the intern position at MX.</p>

            <p>Danielle slept through the night almost immediately as a baby and had hair so beautiful that perfect strangers would stop us to compliment her. She tenaciously competed to win the "Math around the World" competition in her first grade classroom. And although she barely weighs 100 lbs as a full-grown adult, she is still Dad's number one choice for lifting the heaviest furniture in the house. He brags about that as often as he brags about her almost perfect ACT score and her winning a competitive Honors' Scholarship at Arkansas State University.</p>

            <p>She will eat almost anything (everything!), and is a loyal and dedicated young woman with a bright future. You will quickly find that Danielle can solve almost any problem.</p>

            Best regards, <br />
            Dixie D. Thompson <br />
